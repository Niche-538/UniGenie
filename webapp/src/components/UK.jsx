                                    Most Master's Degrees are taught courses,
                                    consisting of lectures and seminars followed
                                    by a dissertation project. Research Master's
                                    involves much more independent work, but the
                                    exact difference between a taught and
                                    research Master's varies. An M.Res. (Master
                                    of Research) usually involves longer (or
                                    multiple) dissertation tasks. An M.Phil.
                                    (Master of Philosophy) is entirely
                                    research-based and may form part of a Ph.D.
                                    Research Master's are less common outside
                                    the UK.

                                    applications. A GPA of 3.0 or higher is
                                    usually considered 'good' - and is roughly
                                    equivalent to a UK 2.1. Universities in the
                                    UK and Europe don't usually use the GPA
