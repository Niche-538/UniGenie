            </h4>
            <p>
              Business Administration is the process of organizing the
              business's personnel and resources to meet business goals and
              objectives. These processes include but not limited to Human
              Resources, Operations, Financial Management, and Marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Masters of Business Administration (MBA) abroad includes an
              array of subjects and careers. This is probably the most fancied
              course among students who aspire to become top tier executives in
              corporations. It is also one of the most expensive and sought
              after courses. Management is fancied for its excellent ROI and
              relevance in a globalized world. But management courses are no
              more restricted only to Business Administration, since the
              prospects for jobs and employment are limitless.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those who wish to get back to their working life soon, then
              study MBA abroad because then you can minimize the time to
              complete the course. For example, the 1-year program offered by
              many European universities would be ideal. On the other hand, most
              of the US universities offer the traditional two year program.
              Depending on the convenience and affordability of the students to
              stay away from the job market, MBA is divided into different
              categories such as -
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Full-time MBA:</b> It is for the students who are willing to
              leave their job and dedicate their full time to the weekday
              classes and studying.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Part-time MBA:</b> It is for those who wish to enhance their
              career by acquiring managerial skills while still being employed.
              It is also known as the Evening or Weekend MBA program as the
              classes are held during the weekends.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Executive MBA:</b> It is designed for experienced and working
              executives, managers, entrepreneurs, and other business leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Global MBA:</b> It aims at providing international business
              experience to its students. The classes are conducted in different
              classroom environments, at times different countries and cultures
              too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dual MBA: It involves adding another Masters degree to the MBA
              course.
