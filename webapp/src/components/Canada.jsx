                                countries in the world. The government of Canada
                                spends graciously on education and academics to
                                maintain their standards.

                                last century and half. It was also the first
                                country to introduce multicultural policy back
                                in the 70s.

                                of study you choose, it is cheaper than US and
                                UK universities.

                                    universities working on an area where you
                                    are most interested in. Carefully study the
                                    most recent and active projects that the
                                    Professors are working on. Check if the
                                    Professors have an active grant and are
                                    willing to hire new grad students. Without a

                                    a Professor. Try to find a few tutorials
                                    online on how to prepare a research summary
                                    by listing down the strong and
                                    weak/improvement points of a research paper.
                                    Sending this will increase your chances and
                                    will give some assurance to the Professors
                                    that you are interested and willing to
                                    commit yourself to take up the stage. If the
                                    Professor doesn't get back to you, wait for
                                    a couple of weeks and then send him/her a
